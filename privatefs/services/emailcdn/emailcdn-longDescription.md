Install an agent near your application, and allow Email CDN to replicate
email accounts from remote email servers such as IMAP, GMail, or Exchange.

Local email messages are accessible via IMAP as well as a Nylas-compatible web API,
simplifying programmatic integrations. Emails are also fulltext indexed, and made
accessible via Lambda and map-reduce mechanisms.

Local network access to emails ensures business continuity for your applications
during WAN and cloud email provider outages, while also ensuring optimal
application performance.
