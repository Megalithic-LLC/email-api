## Migrate from Linux Email

Install our agent on a server running legacy Linux email services, and allow us to perform a fully
managed in-place migration. Your new email server will be fully cloud-managed,
and immediately benefit from our agent's crash-proof virtualized storage with
live backups, live snapshotting, and cloud-based secondary storage.
